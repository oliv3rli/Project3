This project is about developing a learning analytics dashboard based on clicker data. You will work as a team to learn how to make a dashboard using R Shiny (official page with several tutorials: <https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/>).

**Learning Objectives**

1.  Understand the structure of clicker data
2.  Create multiple different visualizations
3.  Design and implement an instructor and student dashboard
4.  Critically evaluate your own dashboard design

You are given aggregated clicker records for a CS course taught at Cornell. There are two datasets: the experience dataset and the quiz dataset.

**Scenario**

You are approached by a college instructor who uses iClickers in her CS class on Business Intelligence. She would like to gain insights about her students and how they are engaging/performing in order to better help them in class. She would also like to better support students by giving them feedback at scale about where they stand and perhaps how they compare to others in the class.

You offer to build a prototype of a dashboard using her clicker data: this is a dashboard for the instructor which offers an overview of the class characteristics, engagement, and performance; and it is a dashboard for students which offers a specific student an overview of their engagement and performance (and how it compares to others).

**Data**

The **experience dataset** contains one record per student who completed the CS course between 2016-2018. There are two sources to this dataset: Faculty Center and a Skills Survey (administered via the Blackboard LMS) where students self reported their skill level for various skills the first week of class. This data has been de-identified. Name, netid, emplid, major have all been removed and replaced with a unique numeric identifier. Note that not all students completed the skills survey, they will have null values for the survey result fields.

| Attribute Name | Data Type | Definition |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| student_key | numeric Unique key | Assigned as part of de-identification process. Uniquely identifies student records for this data set only. |
| year | numeric | Four digit year student was enrolled in BI Class. |
| prog | character Values (GRAD, UGRAD) | Indicates whether the student was a graduate or undergraduate student when they were enrolled in BI course. |
| database_score | numeric (0-5) | Self reported experience level with database technology prior to taking course. 0= no experience, 5= expertise |
| sql_score | numeric (0-5) | Self reported experience level with SQL prior to taking course. 0= no experience, 5=expertise |
| programing_score | numeric (0-5) | Self reported experience level with Any Programing language prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise |
| stored_proc_score | numeric (0-5) | Self reported experience level with stored procedure languages prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise |
| etl_score | numeric (0-5) | Self reported experience level with Extract Transform Load (ETL) development prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise |
| data_vis_score | numeric (0-5) | Self reported experience level using data visualization tools prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise |
| requirement_gather_score | numeric (0-5) | Self reported experience level gathering customer requirements prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise |
| skill_survey_score | numeric | Sum of the self reported skill level scores. |

The **quiz dataset** contains one record per student per class session held where iClickers were used. Sources used in the creation of this data set include: iClicker session xml files, Blackboard gradebook (for quiz scores), and the Blackboard class schedule (used to map iClicker session to related quiz scores). Note that in some cases there are multiple iClicker sessions / lectures associated with a single quiz. This dataset may be joined to the experience dataset by the student_key field.

| Attribute Name | Data Type | Definition |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Acad_date_key | numeric | Date key in the form of YYYYMMDD indicating the date the class session was held. |
| student_key | numeric | Unique identifier for students who took BI class 2016-2018. This key is the primary key for the experience_data file. |
| year | numeric | Four digit year class session was held. |
| session_number | numeric | Identifies the session number for a particular semester. Session number is assigned by iClicker. |
| quiz_number | numeric | There are 10 quizzes throughout the BI course. This attribute indicates which quiz is associated with the iClicker session(s). |
| attended | numeric (0,1) | Binary indicating whether the student attended that particular class session / lecture. 0=no, 1=yes. |
| total_possible_clicker | numeric | The total number of iClicker questions asked that session. |
| total_completed_clicker | numeric | The number of iClicker questions answered by student that session. |
| completed_q_clicker | numeric | The number of completed Quiz iClicker questions |
| correct_q_clicker | numeric | How many correct Quiz answers by student that session. |
| completed_t_clicker | number | How many Temperature questions answered by student that session. Temperature questions are 0-5, 0= bad, 5=great. There is no correct answer to Temperature questions, they are used to guage how students are feeling about a particular subject, assignment, etc. |
| avg_t_clicker | number | The average temperature answer by student for that session. An average of 1 or 2 would be generally negative, while 4 or 5 would be generally positive responses. |
| quiz_score | numeric | Quiz score out of 20 points possible. |

# Part 1: Planning / Sketching

Go through the planning / sketching process described in the reading about dashboards. While some dashboards are certainly better than others, there is not one correct solution here. However, spending enough time to make a concrete plan is essential for the success of your project. Everything you do to make the dashboards will be easier if you have a clear plan, especially because you will be splitting up the work and everyone needs to know what they should work on.

**Question 1:** You will make a student dashboard and a teacher dashboard. Carefully consider the implications of this for design and content. To plan, answer the following prompts once for the student dashboard and then for the teacher dashboard. The more concrete you are here the easier it will be later. Focus on the concrete ideas that you will implement in the next steps. You can iterate on this step and modify your responses as your ideas for the dashboard become clearer. You should explore the dataset in R for 5-10 minutes to get a good sense of what the dataset has to offer.

*Planning for the student dashboard*

-   For whom? Who will use it and what is their background?
    -   Target user: Individual students enrolled in the CS Business Intelligence course at Cornell (undergraduates or graduates).
    -   Background: These students have varying backgrounds in programming, SQL, and data analysis. They are familiar with iClickers and quizzes but may have limited experience interpreting analytics dashboards.
-   Why? What is the goal? What questions to answer?
    -   Goal: To help students understand their own engagement and performance in the course, identify areas for improvement, and see how they compare to class averages.

    -   Key questions:

        -   How often am I attending class and participating in iClicker sessions?
        -   How am I performing on quizzes compared to the class average?
        -   How am I feeling about the course (temperature questions) relative to others?
        -   Which skills (from the skills survey) are my strengths/weaknesses compared to classmates?
        -   How has my engagement or performance changed over time?
-   What? What data to show and what is its structure?
    -   Data:
        -   Attendance (from the quiz dataset): % sessions attended.
        -   Participation: Number of iClicker questions completed vs. total possible.
        -   Quiz Scores: Individual scores for each quiz and session.
        -   Skill Survey: Self-reported skill levels, and how those compare to class.
        -   Temperature Responses: Average temperature (wellbeing/morale) over time, and compared to peers.
    -   Structure: The dashboard will pull data for the specific student (via student_key), and class-level aggregates for comparison.
-   How? How will visualizations support the goal?
    -   Visualizations will provide quick feedback, reveal trends, and offer comparison. Each visualization will use highlighting and clear labeling to show where the student stands:
        -   Attendance & participation over time: Bar/line chart, student highlighted vs. class average.
        -   Quiz scores: Line chart or dot plot, with class average and student's own score.
        -   Skills radar/spider chart: Compare self to class median or quartiles.
        -   Temperature trend: Line or area plot for student vs. class.
        -   Summary statistics/tables: Key numbers for quick self-check.

*Planning for the instructor dashboard*

-   For whom? Who will use it and what is their background?
    -   Target user: Instructor of the CS Business Intelligence course at Cornell
    -   Background: The instructor is a college professor at Cornell who uses iClickers in her class for student engagement. She has been teaching the class for a few years and may not have a lot of experience in making/interpreting dashboards.
-   Why? What is the goal? What questions to answer?
    -   Goal: To help the instructor get an overall understanding of the class characteristics and how students as a whple are performing and engaging in her class. This summative information may be helpful for her for adjusting teaching strategies to better help her students.

    -   Key questions:

        -   What are the attendance rates for each class session?
        -   What is the spread of quiz scores across the classroom?
        -   How confident are students on the topics covered in each class session?
        -   Which students may need extra attention/assistance in the course?
-   What? What data to show and what is its structure?
    -   Engagement Over Time: Average \# of clicker questions completed for each class date plotted as a line graph over all dates class was held
    -   Quiz Score Distribution: Distribution of all quiz scores shown on a histogram
    -   Average Temperature by Session: Average of the temperature responses for each session number
    -   At Risk Students: Highlight students with a low attendance rate or avg quiz score, displayed as a table
-   How? How will visualizations support the goal?
    -   Visualizations will provide simple summary of the class statistics, showing how students are performing and engaging in class.
        -   Engagement Over Time: Line graph, Date vs Avg Clicker Questions
            -   visualizes engagement of class
        -   Quiz Score Distribution: Histogram, Quiz Score vs Frequency
            -   visualizes performance of class
        -   Average Temperature by Session: Line graph, Session Number vs Avg Temperature
            -   visualizes performance of class/how class feels about the content
        -   At Risk Students: Table, With student key, program, attendance rate, and avg quiz score
            -   highlights students who may need extra help

**Question 2:** Based on your plan above, make a sketch of what the dashboard would look like. See this week's readings for examples. Be detailed about what kinds of data points and visualizations you want to see in different parts of the page. Consider the user experience and how you should position more general information compared to more specific information, and where you may need some additional explanation to help the viewer understand a graphic, for example. In your sketch, it is useful to give labels to different objects, because in the steps below you can split up work between team members and the labels will help you connect the UI with the data objects. Show your sketches in section to get feedback from the teaching team.

Each dashboard should contain at least 4 data visualizations. You may include any additional summary statistics (e.g. key percentages or tables).

# Part 2: Dashboard Wire-frame Implementation

This is where you generate the dashboard layout. You are given a very basic wire frame example for the dashboard below. For more information on how R Shiny Dashboards work, look at <https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/get_started.html> and <https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/structure.html>. You can add different types of content into a `fuidRow()`. In the starter code, there are 2 rows of content: the first has two little info boxes; the second has two larger viz boxes. You can add more rows and change what is in them as you wish. Follow the naming convention, e.g. `inst.info1` is the first info box for instructors.

Your team can split up the tasks. Some work on creating the UI (this part), while others work on pre-processing the data and creating the statistics and visualizations that will populate the UI (next part).

**Question 3:** Create the layout for the dashboard tabs. You can have as many "tabs" as you like. Each tab is the content displayed when the user clicks on one of the menu items (so it is the page content). Here you are just specifying the wire frame i.e. **what goes where on the pages**, not what goes into it.

# Part 3: Data Pre-processing

Get the data ready for use in the dashboard. Before the next stage, you want to have the data ready in the right format for simple computations and plotting. To do this effectively, you need to know by now what you want to display in each dashboard. However, this is also an iterative process. Once you have completed a first iteration of the design, you can come back to this step and add further pre-processing for more visualizations you like to add. This step is also an opportunity to better understand the structure of the datasets.

The instructor dashboard should show information for all students. The student dashboard is typically focused on an individual student. You can either pick a student (at random or intentionally) and use them as the "reference student" for the student dashboard. Or, a bit more ambitious but also more rewarding to try out, you can create an interactive dashboard in which you select the student and then the dashboard updates to show the information for that student. I would recommend you start with the simpler version and get that to work before you try to make it dynamic.

Use the space below to be ready for your information visualizations in the dashboards.

# Part 4: Prepare All Data Visualizations

This is where you create the content for the wire frames you created above. Again, you can refer to the examples and documentation in <https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/get_started.html> and <https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/structure.html> for guidance. You can also find many examples online just by searching with Google.

**Question 4:** For each of the pieces of content you planned for in the wire frames above, generate the relevant content. You need to assign them all to the `output` variable by referencing the name of the wire frame element you chose above like this `output$name.of.element`.

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
  full_data <- full_data |>
    mutate(
      attended                = as.numeric(attended),
      total_completed_clicker = as.numeric(total_completed_clicker),
      avg_t_clicker           = as.numeric(avg_t_clicker),
      quiz_score              = as.numeric(quiz_score),
      session_number          = as.numeric(session_number)
    )
  
  # —— STUDENT DASHBOARD STARTS HERE ——
  
  # Update dropdown choices for student selection
  observe({
    updateSelectInput(session, "student_id",
                      choices = sort(unique(dashboard_data$student_summary$student_key)))
  })

  # Filtered data for selected student
  student_data <- reactive({
    req(input$student_id)
    dashboard_data$quiz %>% filter(student_key == input$student_id)
  })

  student_summary <- reactive({
    req(input$student_id)
    dashboard_data$student_summary %>% filter(student_key == input$student_id)
  })

  student_skills <- reactive({
    req(input$student_id)
    dashboard_data$experience_long %>% filter(student_key == input$student_id)
  })

  # Value boxes
  output$attendance_box <- renderValueBox({
    valueBox(
      paste0(round(student_summary()$attendance_rate * 100, 1), "%"),
      subtitle = "Attendance Rate",
      icon = icon("calendar-check"),
      color = "blue"
    )
  })

  output$quiz_avg_box <- renderValueBox({

# Part 5: Produce Dashboard and Reflect

You should be able to simply run the code below **as is** to see your dashboard.

**Note:** Unfortunately, you cannot knit this part into a pdf. So I added `eval=FALSE` to let the knitting run smoothly and you can submit your PDF.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#######################################
### This code creates the dashboard ###
#######################################

# Here we set up the Header of the dashboard
dhead = dashboardHeader(title = "Clicker Dashboard")

# Here set up the sidebar which has links to two pages
dside = dashboardSidebar(
  sidebarMenu(
    menuItem("Instructor View", tabName = "instructor", icon = icon("dashboard")),
    menuItem("Student View", tabName = "student", icon = icon("th"))
  )
)

# Here we set up the body of the dashboard
dbody = dashboardBody(
    tabItems(
      student_dash,
      instructor_tab
    )
)

# Combining header, sidebar, and body
ui = dashboardPage(dhead, dside, dbody)

# Generating a local instance of your dashboard
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

**Question 5:** Add screenshots of your group's dahsboards below using this syntax or simply add them to the Word document after knitting:

![Dashboard Screenshot](example_dash.png)

**Question 6:** Evaluate your group dashboard from the perspective of the instructor (teacher dashboard) and from the perspective of the student (student dashboard). What do you like about it, what would you change or add to it if you had more time?

*Reflection for the student dashboard*

-   What do you like about it?
    -   The tabbed layout allows easy navigation across different dimensions of learning. We designed the time-series plots that overlay points and lines to help students quickly spot trends and gaps over the semester.
-   What would you change or add to it if you had more time?
    -   If we had more time, we would integrate percentile gauges or sparklines that compare a student’s metrics to class averages. It will help students to know what grades they possibly have and encourage them to work harder. We’d also build a drill-down feature on the Performance tab so students can click into individual quizzes for question-level feedback or topic-level strengths and weaknesses.
-   What was the biggest challenge you faced? How did you address it?
    -   The biggest challenge we had was handling reactive data updates when a different student was selected—especially in sessions where values were missing. We addressed this by using req() to ensure render functions only fire once a valid student is chosen, and by always summarizing with na.rm = TRUE so charts gracefully skip over any NA values. This approach kept the dashboard responsive and error-free.

*Reflection for the teacher dashboard*

-   What do you like about it?
    -   The dashboard displays the most important class‐level metrics in large info boxes, so the instructor can see overall class conditions rapidly. The four plots contains the information of engagement trends, score distributions, attendance vs. performance relationships, and session‐by‐session sentiment, giving a well–rounded view of how the class behaves over time. The consistent color‐coded boxes and clear labels help guide the eye from one section to the next.
-   What would you change or add to it if you had more time?
    -   If we had more time, we would add interactive filters so the instructor could slice by semester, year, or program. We’d also include drill-down links on the “At-Risk Students” table to pop up individual profiles or sparkline mini-charts. A predictive “early-warning” module would make the dashboard more actionable. Instructor can help students at risks and encourage them to put more effort on this course.
-   What was the biggest challenge you faced? How did you address it?
    -   The hardest part was balancing responsiveness with visualizations: summarizing 2+ years of per-session, per-student data on every render was slowing down the app. We solved this by precomputing aggregated summary tables outside of each renderPlot(), then caching them in reactive values so that the heavy work only runs once at startup or when the underlying data changes. This improved load times and made the dashboard easy to read.
